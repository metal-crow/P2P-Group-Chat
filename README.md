P2P-Group-Chat
==============

Rudimentary P2P (only technically) group chat I've made.

Currently in beta.  
It can communicate with other connected users over LAN, but i haven't tested it over the internet. I also haven't implemented encryption.  
Next steps are  
	Allow other connected users to take over as host if host disconnects  
	Test over internet and have multiple hosts managing their LAN groups able to connect (ideally this will be more like true P2P)  
	Implement encryption
